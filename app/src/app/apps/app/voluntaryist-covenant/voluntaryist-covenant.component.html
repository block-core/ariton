          <h1>The Voluntaryist Covenant</h1>

          <strong>Introduction:</strong><br />
          We, the Voluntaryists, voluntarily and solemnly establish this Covenant to declare our commitment to the
          principles of Voluntaryism. We recognize that every individual is the sole owner of their life, person and
          property, and that no one has the right to initiate force or coercion against another person. We believe that
          freedom and voluntary cooperation are the keys to a just and prosperous society, and we pledge to live our
          lives in accordance with these principles.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 1: Self-Ownership</strong><br />
          We believe that every individual is the sole and sovereign owner of their own body, mind, and labor, and has
          the right to exercise full control over them. We reject any claim by others, including a self-proclaimed
          governing body or state, to own or control the lives or bodies of individuals. We pledge to respect the
          principle of Self-Ownership and to defend it against any aggression or violation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 2: Non-Aggression Principle</strong><br />
          We believe in the Non-Aggression Principle, which asserts that it is immoral to initiate force, coercion,
          theft or fraud against another person in order to achieve personal or collective goals. We also recognize the
          right of every individual to defend their person, their property and liberty against any aggression or
          violation. We pledge to refrain from any aggression in all our interactions and to defend ourselves
          accordingly.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 3: Property Rights</strong><br />
          We recognize that every individual has the right to acquire property, use it, and dispose of it as they see
          fit provided that they do not violate the Non-Aggression Principle. We pledge to respect the property rights
          of others and to defend our property against any aggression or violation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 4: Freedom of Association</strong><br />
          We believe that every individual has the right to associate or disassociate with others as they see fit, and
          to engage in any peaceful and voluntary exchange of goods or services. We pledge to respect the freedom of
          association and to refrain from any coercion or aggression against individuals or groups based on their
          associations.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 5: Personal Responsibility</strong><br />
          We recognize the importance of personal responsibility and accountability for our own decisions and actions.
          We acknowledge that any agreement we voluntary enter outline the rights and obligations of the parties
          involved. We pledge to always honor our agreements and commitments and act in good faith to defend such rights
          and meet such obligations.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 6: Dispute Resolution</strong><br />
          We believe in the peaceful resolution of disputes through voluntary means, such as negotiation, mediation, or
          arbitration. We pledge to seek voluntary and peaceful resolution of any disputes that may arise between
          individuals or groups, and to respect decisions reached through these means.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Article 7: Education and Advocacy</strong><br />
          We recognize the importance of Education and Advocacy in promoting the principles of Voluntaryism and
          advancing a free and just society. We pledge to educate ourselves about these principles and to advocate for
          their adoption in all areas of society.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
          We, the undersigned, hereby establish this covenant as a voluntary and solemn expression of our commitment to
          the principles of voluntaryism. We pledge to uphold these principles in all our interactions with others, and
          to work towards a society based on freedom, mutual cooperation, and respect for individual rights, including
          the principle of self-ownership, and property.
          <br /><br />
          We recognize and acknowledge that this covenant is based on the natural rights of self-ownership,
          non-aggression, and property rights. We further acknowledge that these rights are inherent to all individuals
          and cannot be legitimately taken away by any human institution.
          <br /><br />
          We therefore hold this covenant to be the supreme law of our voluntaryist community, and we pledge to uphold
          it above all other man-made laws. We recognize that this covenant supercedes all other legal codes, whether
          they be national, international, or otherwise.
          <br /><br />
          In the event of any conflict between this covenant and any other man-made law, we shall abide by the
          principles set forth in this covenant, and shall take all necessary steps to ensure that our actions are in
          accordance with these principles.
          <br /><br />
          We believe that the principles of voluntaryism provide a solid foundation for a just and prosperous society,
          and we are committed to promoting these principles in all areas of our lives. By signing this covenant, we
          affirm our commitment to these principles, and to the creation of a New Free World based on freedom, mutual
          cooperation, and respect for individual rights.

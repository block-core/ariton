        “Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is
        not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the
        threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its
        participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.” - Wei Dai 1998
